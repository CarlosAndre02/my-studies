# Graph Theory

## TODO

- [ ] Different representations of graphs (adjacency lists, adjacency matrices)
- [ ] Types of graphs: un/directed graphs, un/weighted graphs, cycle graphs, a/cyclic graphs
- [ ] Hamiltonian cycles, Eulerian path
- [ ] Breadth-first search, depth-first search
- [ ] Topological sorting
- [ ] Shortest/Longest path on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- [ ] Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, weaknesses, and alternatives
- [ ] Bellman Ford Algorithm
- [ ] Minimum spanning tree
- [ ] A\* search
