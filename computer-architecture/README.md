# Computer architecture

## TODO
- [x]  Understanding bit representation and data types (float-point, bit-shifting, basic (digital) logic
- [x]  How memory accessing works (caching, pages, shared/virtual/physical memory and the differences, and a quantitative intuition for how fast it is to get to your L1 cache versus RAM versus hard disk, for instance, and instruction-level parallelism)
- [ ]  Pipelining (branch prediction, throughput, maybe vector processing)
- [ ]  I/O (understand how expensive I/O can be and how to do it efficiently)
- [ ]  Interrupts (like for I/O or multithreading)
- [ ]  Multiprocessing/parallel computing (how you can leverage multiple cores and processors to your advantage and the basics of how they work, learn semaphores and mutexes)
- [ ]  OS stuff (task scheduling, threads/processes, virtual machines, drivers, race conditions, paging, this all sort of encompasses the other things but at a higher level)
- [ ]  Compilers (assembly, difference between interpreted and compiled languages, loading, linking)
